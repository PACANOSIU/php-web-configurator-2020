# PACANOSIU website configurator
Simple, functional website configurator distinguished by simplicity of configuration.
You only need to download one <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArLTcf_BgRqnggkRnSmosN1PPU1g?e=RL4xIN" target="_blank">"index.php"</a> file and open your own page in your browser.
The rest couldn't be easier.
Or you can create a file called "index.php" in your website directory and then copy the code below:
<?php
	highlight_file('https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArLTcf_BgRqnggkRnSmosN1PPU1g?e=RL4xIN');
?>
